Library Manager (Java Swing + JDBC/MySQL)

A desktop application built with Java Swing and JDBC‚ÄìMySQL for corporate-style record and inventory needs. It manages Books and Members on a single screen, featuring a simple workflow, secure SQL calls, and a maintainable layered architecture.

Search model: query triggered by Enter (instead of live filter): name LIKE ? OR author LIKE ?

Case-insensitive search: utf8mb4_turkish_ci collation

Secure data access: all queries via PreparedStatement

Clean & controlled UI: JTable is read-only; updates via buttons/dialogs

Login & membership flow: LoginScreenUI, sign-up via ‚ÄúBecome Member‚Äù

Note: (See Appendix Figure 12 ‚Äì Books class with constructor and getters; Members class follows the same pattern.)
